# ALX Backend Python Repository

## Overview

This repository contains my backend Python projects from the **ALX Software Engineering Program**, focusing on **asynchronous programming**, **type annotations**, and **software testing**. These projects have helped me build efficient, scalable, and well-structured backend applications using modern Python best practices.

The repository covers key backend development concepts, including:

  * **Type Annotations** â€“ Writing cleaner, more maintainable Python code with explicit type hints.

  * **Asynchronous Programming** â€“ Leveraging asyncio, coroutines, and async comprehensions for high-performance applications.

  * **Unit & Integration Testing** â€“ Ensuring code reliability and robustness through thorough testing techniques.

**Projects :page_with_curl:**

The projects in this repository progressively build expertise in backend Python development:

Back-end - Python
  
  * [0x00. Python - Variable Annotations](./0x00-python_variable_annotations)
  * [0x01. Python - Async](./0x01-python_async_function)
  * [0x02. Python - Async Comprehension](./0x02-python_async_comprehension)
  * [0x03. Unittests and Integration Tests](./0x03-Unittests_and_integration_tests)

## Highlights of My Journey

  * **Python Backend Expertise** â€“ Developed proficiency in asynchronous programming and type annotations.

  * **Optimized Performance** â€“ Gained hands-on experience in building high-performance applications using asyncio.

  * **Code Quality & Testing** â€“ Strengthened my ability to write reliable, maintainable, and well-tested Python code.
